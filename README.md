# 🖼️ Text-to-Image Generator using Stable Diffusion

## 📌 Project Overview
This project leverages the **Stable Diffusion API** from Hugging Face to generate images from text descriptions. By utilizing Python and the `requests` library, users can input a text prompt, and the script communicates with the Stable Diffusion model to generate and save an image.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎨 Generates images based on text input using **Stable Diffusion 2.1**.
- 🌐 Uses the **Hugging Face API** for inference.
- 💾 Saves the generated image automatically.
- 🖥️ Simple and efficient **command-line interaction**.

## 🛠️ Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:

```bash
pip install requests pillow
```

## 🔚 Conclusion
This project showcases how AI-powered image generation can be easily integrated into a Python application using the **Stable Diffusion API**. By automating the process of generating images from textual descriptions, this tool provides an accessible way to experiment with generative AI. Future improvements could include allowing users to specify image styles, resolutions, or batch processing for multiple prompts.
